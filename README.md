# OptiKai

This is entirely unofficial and not developed / maintained by the developer of OptiFine, sp614x.
sp614x is aware of this and gave me permission to redistribute in the OptiFine discord as he thinks it may be cool to allow people to play on snapshots.
Since sp614x cannot develop or maintain these releases, we want to help prevent bug reports as much as possible. Because of this, I have put in a lot of places that it is not official. Like this download page and the installer. I also changed "HD_U" to "HD_K".
The K in "HD_K" stands for Kai, which is my cat's name.

Q: If this can update quickly, why can't sp614x do it?
**A**: I decompile OptiFine's source code and port OptiFine to some of the latest snapshots. I use an entirely different code-base than sp614x, and I cut a lot of corners which allows me to update OptiFine quicker. This is probably the best way to properly port OF to a new snapshot release (sometimes) every week.

Q: Will this update on major releases?
**A**: It is possible for me to port to the latest major release, though, I have decided to *not* do that. I am not wanting to take over OptiFine, so, that is sp614x's job, not mine.
